# Mainframe

</div>

Subnet 25, Mainframe (formerly known as Protein-Folding) is the first decentralized science subnet on Bittensor. Its focus is on creating DeSci technology for pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and academics. Presently, its focus is on using global computing power to simulate protein molecular dynamics via OpenMM, and protein-ligand docking using DiffDock; both processes essential in most drug discovery pipelines. However, this subnet is designed to be adaptive to a wide array of computing-based problems in the life sciences, utilizing Bittensor’s tokenomics and incentive structure to offer affordable solutions.

Mainframe asks a simple question: can a decentralized, incentivized pool of people be used for generalized scientific compute? At Macrocosmos, we believe it is possible. Not only that, we believe that decentralized and accessible in-silico experimentation is imperative to accelerate science.

"Rational simulation-guided design of atomic systems has been a dream of researchers across the chemical sciences for decades. Enabling rapid and performant experimentation to experts would unlock massive potential to accelerate chemical science" [Mann et al. 2025](https://rowansci.com/publications/egret-1-pretrained-neural-network-potentials)

Mainframe attempts to tackle this very important challenge.

## Real-World Impact

</div>

✅ Subnet 25 has partnered with Rowan Scientific, an AI-based chemistry software developer. Together, we’re building next generation neural network potential (NNPs) models via specialized DFT data generation on Mainframe. By collaborating, we’re helping create more powerful drug discovery tools for researchers and academics.

## Subnet statistics

</div>

This subnet has the following statistics backing it, which show its utility and efficiently:

- 162,200 proteins folded since launch 📈
- Simulation speed of approximately 132,000 nsec/day 🏎️
- Approximately 17 petaflops (20% more than Folding@Home)

## Market

</div>

Subnet 25’s product-market-fit is within the following customer groups:

1. Academia: Biochemistry, structural biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics, or pharmaceutical sciences

2. Governments and non-profit organizations: Institutions or national labs focused on health, biotech, or bioinformatics

3. Small labs and startups: Small to mid-sized biotech startups looking to outsource or speed up early-stage discovery

4. Contract research organizations: Service providers doing research for pharma clients.

5. Pharma and biotech companies: In-house drug discovery teams working on lead identification and optimization

This is because Mainframe offers low-cost solutions that many smaller organizations typically would struggle with access to. This is especially the case when it comes to protein-docking via molecular dynamics, which can be costly due to computing power.

<div align="center">

## Subnet Future Value

</div>

Mainframe is poised to become more valuable as it’s being upgraded into a general purpose life-sciences subnet. Its expansion in Q1 2025 from being purely a protein-folding subnet to a tool that can handle a wide range of unique jobs. 

### Use-cases and potential


Mainframe, has several use-cases:
1. Aid in the drug discovery and design process with its protein-folding and docking toolkit.
Use molecular dynamics to generate potential protein and ligand combinations. that could be used to further academic research at a low cost.

2. Help solve computational problems in the life-sciences sector by offering organizations a global pool of computing resources.

3. Since the pivot in 2025 towards the entire life-sciences domain, Mainframe is able to plug into a range of problems in the scientific world. Its aim is to become one of many tools used by researchers to forward their work, and further help save lives.

4. Mainframe’s first collaboration and partnership with Rowan Scientific is an example of how we can support STEM. By helping provide density-functional-theory (DFT) configurations to their work, we’re actively involved in building greater chemical models.
